## AI Thread Metadata
**Source**: perplexity

**Thread**: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/threads-ai-power-up-for-trello-B9KEt.BATcqD5ICA6V4XRA

### Prompt Chain Summary

1. **Initial request**
   - Provide a concise and thorough implementation plan for the Threads.ai Power-Up for Trello. Include tech stack, high-level component makeup, and an enterprise-quality architecture document.

2. **Tech Stack Revision**
   - Use React for frontend
   - Flask for backend
   - Amazon RDS (MySQL) for persistence
   - Grafana/Prometheus for monitoring
   - CircleCI for CI/CD
   - Docker for containerization
   - Use DigitalOcean for production deployment

3. **Simplification**
   - Simplify the proposed stack to make it more suitable for a Trello Power-Up walking skeleton. Find an alternative to Amazon RDS that is less cost-prohibitive. Consider DigitalOcean as a potential solution.

4. **Linode Benefits**
   - Main benefits of using Linode over DigitalOcean for the Trello Power-Up.

5. **Switch to Linode**
   - Switch from DigitalOcean to Linode for hosting and infrastructure services.

These steps include refining the implementation plan for Threadster, with a focus on simplifying the initial stack, reducing costs, and optimizing for performance and scalability.

## Implementation Plan

1. Frontend: React
2. Backend: Flask 
3. Database: Linode Managed Databases (PostgreSQL)
4. Hosting: Linode Compute Instances
5. Monitoring: Basic logging and Linode's built-in monitoring tools
6. CI/CD: GitHub Actions
7. Local Development: Docker and docker-compose
8. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform (for Linode resources)

## Tasks


1. Set up project structure:
   - Create separate directories for frontend (React) and backend (Flask)

2. Frontend development:
   - Initialize a new React project
   - Implement basic components for the Trello Power-Up interface
   - Integrate Trello Power-Up client library

3. Backend development:
   - Set up a Flask project with essential API endpoints
   - Implement SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions

4. Database setup:
   - Provision a Linode Managed Database (PostgreSQL)
   - Create necessary tables for threads, messages, and metadata

5. Docker configuration:
   - Create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
   - Set up docker-compose.yml for local development environment

6. CI/CD pipeline:
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow for testing, building, and deploying

7. Infrastructure as Code:
   - Use Terraform to define Linode resources:
     - Compute Instances for hosting
     - Managed Database
     - Networking configurations

8. Monitoring and logging:
   - Implement basic logging in the application
   - Set up Linode's built-in monitoring tools

9. Trello Power-Up specific implementation:
   - Create the Power-Up manifest file
   - Implement core capabilities (card buttons, board buttons, card badges)

10. Local development environment:
    - Create scripts for easy local setup and development
    - Implement hot-reloading for both frontend and backend

11. Production deployment:
    - Configure production-ready settings for all components
    - Set up secure communication between frontend, backend, and database

12. Testing:
    - Implement basic unit tests for core functionality in both frontend and backend

Benefits of this Linode-based approach:

1. Better performance-to-cost ratio, potentially allowing for more resources within your budget
2. Excellent customer support, which can be crucial during development and deployment
3. Flexible scaling options as your Power-Up grows
4. Linux-friendly environment, which aligns well with your tech stack
5. Global network of data centers for low-latency access
6. Advanced features like automated backups and DDoS protection
